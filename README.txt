Why?

Experimenting what you can do with open data that has Finnish company ID’s (‘Y-tunnus’). Hoping to learn Python while doing so. Finnish company related open data sources include for example:

What data?

City of Helsinki decisions:
http://dev.hel.fi/apis/openahjo/

Finnish patent and registration office
http://avoindata.prh.fi/ytj.html

Public purchases of Helsinki metropolitan area cities
http://www.hri.fi/fi/dataset/helsingin-kaupungin-ostot 
http://www.hri.fi/fi/dataset/vantaan-kaupungin-ostot 
http://www.hri.fi/fi/dataset/espoon-kaupungin-ostot 

Paid taxes by companies from Finnish Tax Administraion
http://www.vero.fi/fi-FI/Avoin_data%2829357%29 

Food control related data from Helsinki

What does Y-Factor folder consist of?

Y-Factor - Villen -folder will initially have some very basic Python code to fetch data from various open data sources. These sources include City of Helsinki Open Ahjo (http://dev.hel.fi/apis/openahjo) and Finnish patent and registration office API (http://avoindata.prh.fi/index_en.html). In addition the folder will have CSV-files created by the  Python programs.

Working also with other (definitely more talented programmers…:) on this path of open data exploration and discovery. So more folders with useful code and other outputs hopefully in the future to be found here or linked to from here.
